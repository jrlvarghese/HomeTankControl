Stopped working on september 2019: (Problem with the switching hardware, MOC3041 is damaged)

October 14, 2019: Switching hardware problem rectified, a circuit as described in motorolla MOC3041 datasheet is used.

                  Input resistor used is 220 ohms (earlier a blue LED used in series)
                  
                  Output circuit is modified, earlier output to the gate (BTA12) is given only through single resistor (470 ohms), 
                    from pin 4 of the optocoupler.
